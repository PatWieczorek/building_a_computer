I need to understand how a computer works in-depth, so all my low-level abstraction thinking will have a solid grounding in reality, so I have decided to build a computer following this <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686 tag="a1">book</a>.

Let's go!

<b>part 0x01</b><br>
I have built 16 elementary logic gates starting from nand.<br>
It was a healthy exercise in boolean logic.

<b>part 0x02</b><br>
I have created a simple adder that adds 2 bits then I used it to make a 16-bit adder.<br>
Having that done, I have spent a good deal of my time creating an ALU, the first part of the CPU.

<b>part 0x03</b><br>
This week was a transition from combinational logic to sequential logic.<br>
First, I have created 1-bit register, which I extended to 16-bit register chip, then I recursively increased its size.<br> 
The final product was a 16-bit,16384 register RAM chip.
