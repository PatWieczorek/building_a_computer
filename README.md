I need to understand how a computer really works, so all my low level abstraction thinking will have a solid grounding in reality, so I have decided to build a computer following this <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686 tag="a1">book</a>.

Let's go!

<b>part 0x01</b><br>
I have built 16 elementary logic gates starting from nand.<br>PS. Don't underestimate demultiplexers. 

<b>part 0x02</b><br>
I have started with creating a simple adder that adds 2 bits. Then I moved onto 16 bit adder.<br>
Since I have learned how to add, I wanted to learn how to subtract as well.
Therefore I had to understand how a negative number is stored then create a chip that would reverse the value of a number.
