I need to understand how a computer works in-depth, so all my low-level abstraction thinking will have a solid grounding in reality, so I have decided to build a computer following this <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686 tag="a1">book</a>.

Let's go!

<b>part 0x01</b><br>
I have built 16 elementary logic gates starting from nand.<br>
It was a healthy exercise in boolean logic.

<b>part 0x02</b><br>
I have created a simple adder that adds 2 bits then I used it to make a 16-bit adder.<br>
There was no need to create a subtracting chip, but to realize that I have had to understand <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement>how a negative number is stored </a> in a modern computer.<br>
Having that done, I have spent a good deal of my time creating an ALU, the first part of the CPU.
